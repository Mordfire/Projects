880 MIDI music files for training. The model predicts only a couple of notes (2-3), but that is fixed with the use of randomness in the selecting of notes. The number of random selected notes can be tweaked, and there really is no a "good" number, but for better results it should be more than 4. Also when using the piano sound, note_off message for midi is not needed, but for most other types of sounds track.append(mido.Message('note_off', note=seq, velocity=64, time=105)) should be uncommented.
